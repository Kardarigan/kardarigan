I'm Darigan, a Persian Software Engineer from Chicago in Illinois

I hate using transition and dumb animations on websites, building GUI apps, and goofing on Social Media that are filled with selfish people without useful content. I wish I could describe it to people and use just two colors, Black and Red in all my websites, building all programs without GUI just in Console. After all, I will completely disappear Linux and all of its distributions (except BlackArch because of it's name) and make a world of Windows users. but don't scared im done these things many time even for myself.

Let's write lots of Codes ðŸ—½

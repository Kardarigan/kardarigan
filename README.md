A Persian-American Software Engineer who dislike using transition and dumb animations on websites, building GUI apps, and goofing in Social Media that are filled with selfish people without useful content. I wish I could describe it to people and use just two colors, Black and Red in all my websites, building all programs without GUI just in Console. After all, I will completely disappear the Linux and all of its distributions (except BlackArch because it's name) and make a world of Windows users . . .


Let's write lots of Codes ðŸ—½
